# Compilers_Project_1 (2 Parts)
My assignments for my course on compilers
# Part 1
I have to make a parser(written in Java) that will accept and calculate expressions with (, ), 0-9, ^(xor), &(and) by building a parse tree.
# Part 2
I have to make a lexer (.lex file) and a grammar(.cup file) that will be used to accept(or decline) a specific language's programs. Lexer breaks program input in chunks and grammar checks if these chunks belong to the grammar or not.
